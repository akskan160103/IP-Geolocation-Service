# SpotScope

## Project Overview

**SpotScope** is an IP geolocation tool designed to locate and display information associated with specific IP addresses.

### Features:

- **IP to Location Mapping**: Input an IP address (e.g., `12.34.54.34`), and SpotScope fetches relevant details such as city, longitude, and latitude.
- **Visual Representation**: The geolocation data is then showcased on a map, pinpointing the exact or approximate location.
- **Database Lookup**: The application leverages a MongoDB database, populated with GeoLite2 data from MaxMind, ensuring accurate and up-to-date IP information.
- **Error Handling**: If an IP is not found within the database, users are notified accordingly.

**Deployment Plans**: Currently, SpotScope operates locally. Future plans involve hosting it online to serve as a showcase for potential recruiters and users.
